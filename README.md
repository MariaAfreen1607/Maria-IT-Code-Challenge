# Maria-IT-Code-Challenge
"IT Code Challenge" proposed by University of Louisiana, Monroe
* Brief Elaboration:
* A very simple website using the basics of HTML/CSS to create an alumni directory.
* Could have incorporated JavaScript for effective functionality but that's all what I tried my best to learn so far in Fall Break! Perhaps in future somewhere.
* The dataset was provided by the respective student organization to work upon it.
